This is a real-time-chat app made using react and node js.
To run this application you need node js and npm installed on your computer.
To get this running, follow these steps:
Download the zipped v1.0.0 release file
Create a directory real-time-chat-app and extract the zipped file there.
Open that folder on vscode and open a terminal. Run "npm start" to start the server.
Open another terminal and run: "cd client" and start the react client by running "npm start"
A window on your default web browser will appear after like a minute.
Now you can interact with the application.
